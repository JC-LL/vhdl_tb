# vhdl_tb
A simple VHDL testbench generator written in Ruby.

vhdl_tb (or its alias tbgen) generates a VHDL testbench from an file containing a entity-architecture pair.
The generated code is similar to what vhdl-mode for emacs can generate.

To build the Ruby gem, type :
```bash
gem build vhdl_tb.gemspec
```

To install :
```bash
gem install --local vhdl_tb-<VERSION>.gem
```

More to come later.
